CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:34 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target Incursio_v20 because
  files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libsfml-network.so.2.5] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /doc/libs/SFML-2.5.1/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
